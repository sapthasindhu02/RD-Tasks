        "longDescription": "From rather humble beginnings as the Personal Home Page scripting language, PHP has found its way into almost every server, corporation, and dev shop in the world. On an average day, somewhere between 500,000 and 2 million coders do something in PHP. Even when you use a well-understood language like PHP, building a modern web application requires tools that decrease development time and cost while improving code quality. Frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a result.     For PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise without the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of components can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the development process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend Technologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language in which it is written. The first production release of the Zend Framework became available in July of 2007.    Zend Framework in Action is a comprehensive tutorial that shows how to use the Zend Framework to create web-based applications and web services. This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application. This book is organized around the techniques you'll use every day as a web developer \"data handling, forms, authentication, and so forth. As you follow the running example, you'll learn to build interactive Ajax-driven features into your application without sacrificing nuts-and-bolts considerations like security and performance.  This book is aimed at the competent PHP developer who wants to master framework-driven web development. Zend Framework in Action goes beyond the docs but still provides quick access to the most common topics encountered in the development of web applications.  ",

        "longDescription": "In the demo, a hip designer, a sharply-dressed marketer, and a smiling, relaxed developer sip lattes and calmly discuss how Flex is going to make customers happy and shorten the workday   all while boosting the bottom line. The software systems they're using have been carefully selected and built from the ground up to work together seamlessly. There are no legacy systems, data, or competing business concerns to manage.    Cut to reality.    You're a Java developer. The marketing guy tells you that \"corporate\" wants a Flex-based site and you have to deliver it on top of what you already have. Your budget  Don't even ask. \"Make it look like the Discovery channel or something.\"    Flex on Java assumes you live in the real world   not the demo. This unique book shows you how to refactor an existing web application using the server-side you already know. You'll learn to use Flex 3 in concert with Spring, EJB 3, POJOs, JMS, and other standard technologies. Wherever possible, the examples use free or open source software.    The authors start with a typical Java web app and show you how to add a rich Flex interface. You also learn how to integrate Flex into your server-side Java via the BlazeDS framework, Adobe's open-source remoting and web messaging technology for Flex.    The book shows you how to deploy to not only the web but also to the desktop using the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). You will learn how to integrate Flex into your existing applications in order to build a next generation application that will delight users.    Flex on Java is approachable for anyone beginning Java and Flex development.    ",

        "longDescription": "Although several options exist for interface development in Java, even popular UI toolkits like Swing have been notoriously complex and difficult to use. Griffon, an agile framework that uses Groovy to simplify Swing, makes UI development dramatically faster and easier. In many respects, Griffon is for desktop development what Grails is for web development. While it's based on Swing, its declarative style and approachable level of abstraction is instantly familiar to developers familiar with other technologies such as Flex or JavaFX.    Griffon in Action is a comprehensive tutorial written for Java developers who want a more productive approach to UI development. In this book, you'll immediately dive into Griffon. After a Griffon orientation and a quick Groovy tutorial, you'll start building examples that explore Griffon's high productivity approach to Swing development. One of the troublesome parts of Swing development is the amount of Java code that is required to get a simple application off the ground.    You'll learn how SwingBuilder (and its cousin builders) present a very palatable alternative in the form of a DSL geared towards building graphical user interfaces. Pair it up with the convention over configuration paradigm, a well tested and tried application source structure (based on Grails) and you have a recipe for quick and effective Swing application development. Griffon in Action covers declarative view development, like the one provided by JavaFX Script, as well as the structure, architecture and life cycle of Java application development",

        "shortDescription": "Enterprise OSGi shows a Java developer how to develop to the OSGi Service Platform Enterprise specification, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular enterprise applications. Enterprise OSGi addresses several shortcomings of existing enterprise platforms, such as allowing the creation of better maintainable and extensible applications, and provide a simpler, easier-to-use, light-weight solution to enterprise software development.",
        "longDescription": "A good application framework greatly simplifies a developer's task by providing reusable code modules that solve common, tedious, or complex tasks. Writing a great framework requires an extraordinary set of skills-ranging from deep knowledge of a programming language and target platform to a crystal-clear view of the problem space where the applications to be developed using the framework will be used.    OSGi Application Frameworks shows a Java developer how to build frameworks based on the OSGi service platform. OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problem domain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.    Author Alexandre Alves guides you through major concepts, such as the definition of programming models and modularization techniques, and complements them with samples that have real applicability using industry-proved technologies, such as Spring-DM and Equinox.",

        "shortDescription": "\"Flexible Rails created a standard to which I hold other technical books. You definitely get your money's worth.\"",
        "longDescription": "Rails is a fantastic tool for web application development, but its Ajax-driven interfaces stop short of the richness you gain with a tool like Adobe Flex. Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUD application. Together, they're an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to build next-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it's an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book, you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it \"Flex Immersion.\" You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.    You will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.    Flexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than are possible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.",

        "longDescription": "In complex software projects, managing the development process can be as critical to success as writing the code itself. A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.    Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft's Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on. Because in software development one size does not fit all, TFS provides process customization, project management, and reporting capabilities to build solutions around your requirements.    Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a hands-on guide to Team Foundation Server 2008. Written for developers with a good handle on TFS basics, this book shows you how to solve real-life problems. It's not a repetition of Microsoft's product documentation. Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a practitioner's handbook for how to work with TFS under common constraints. This book walks you through real-life software engineering problems based on hundreds of hours of TFS experience.    You'll benefit from expert author Jamil Azher's extensive interactions with members of Microsoft's TFS team and MVPs, survey feedback from the author's blog, and interviews with organizations and user groups using TFS. Instead of just offering a high-level overview, the book provides detailed solutions for solving common   and not-so-common   problems using TFS. It discusses the strengths as well as weaknesses of TFS, and suggests appropriate problem resolution steps, workarounds, or custom solutions.",

        "longDescription": "It's easy to get excited about building a new software project from scratch. So-called \"greenfield\" projects often involve learning new technology and the opportunity for experimentation. Working on established software projects may seem less glamorous.    Most software developers have inherited a monolithic application where the day-to-day tasks involve maintenance, incremental improvements, or even cleaning up the mess another programmer left behind. These legacy or brownfield projects often have tightly coupled components, low cohesion, and poor separation of concerns, making them fragile and resistant to change.    Brownfield Application Development in .Net shows you how to approach legacy applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you've learned to apply to new projects. Using an existing application as an example, this book guides you in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.    As the book proceeds, the authors introduce frameworks and tools commonly used today while still approaching the subject from a conceptual level so that you can substitute alternate tools as appropriate. This book examines the reasons why a tool is necessary, not the tool itself. Because the book is based on the authors' experiences, Brownfield Application Development in .Net moves beyond the theories and shows you the techniques you need to be successful.",

A series of tutorials designed for MongoDB mastery then leads into detailed examples for leveraging MongoDB in e-commerce, social networking, analytics, and other common applications.    Along the way, all of MongoDB's major features are covered, including:        * Indexes and explain plans for efficient queries      * Atomic operations for managing simple data structures and manipulating complex, rich documents      * GridFS for storing and managing large binary objects (images, videos, etc.) in MongoDB      * Map-reduce for custom aggregations and reporting      * Master-slave replication and replica sets for automated failover      * Auto-sharding for automated horizontal scaling    The handy reference section on schema design patterns will help ease the transition from the relational data model of SQL to MongoDB's document-based data model. The numerous, detailed examples are implemented in Ruby and include comprehensive explanations.    MongoDB has been gaining traction in the developer community for its speed, flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. With production deployments that include SourceForge, Foursquare, and Shutterfly, MongoDB is proving to be a robust and reliable database system that keeps developers happy.

This book provides an extensive conceptual framework for 3D user interface techniques, and an in-depth introduction to user interface support in the Java 3D API, including such topics as picking, collision, and drag-and-drop. Many of the techniques are demonstrated in a Java 3D software framework included with the book, which also provides developers with many general-purpose building blocks for constructing their own user interfaces.    Applications and their use of 3D are approached realistically. The book is geared towards sophisticated user interfaces for the \"everyday user\" who doesn't have a lot of time to learn another application--much less a complicated one--and an everyday computer system without exotic devices like head mounted displays and data gloves. Perhaps the best description of this book is: \"A roadmap from Java 3D to 'Swing 3D'.\"",

Ajax is new way of thinking that can result in a flowing and intuitive interaction with the user.\n<br>\n<i>Ajax in Action</i> helps you implement that thinking--it explains how to distribute the application between the client and the server (hint: use a \"nested MVC\" design) while retaining the integrity of the system. You will learn how to ensure your app is flexible and maintainable, and how good, structured design can help avoid problems like browser incompatibilities. Along the way it helps you unlearn many old coding habits. Above all, it opens your mind to the many advantages gained by placing much of the processing in the browser.

Why is this open-source tool so popular  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.
